âœ… How to Test Role-Based Access
Hereâ€™s how you can test that the new security rule is working correctly.

Test 1: Access Denied for a Regular User
Register a new user (or use "alice@example.com" if she's still in your database). This user will have the CUSTOMER role.

Log in as the CUSTOMER user (alice@example.com) to get a JWT token.

Try to access the admin endpoint with that token.

Request:

Method: GET

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/admin/dashboard

Headers:

Authorization: Bearer <token_from_customer_login>

Expected Response:

Status: 403 Forbidden

This proves that users without the ADMIN role cannot access the endpoint.

Test 2: Access Granted for the Admin User
Log in as the default admin user.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login

Body:

JSON

{
    "email": "admin@foodnow.com",
    "password": "admin123"
}
You will receive a new JWT token for the admin.

Access the admin endpoint using the admin's token.

Request:

Method: GET

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/admin/dashboard

Headers:

Authorization: Bearer <token_from_admin_login>

Expected Response:

Status: 200 OK

Body:

JSON

{
    "message": "Welcome to the Admin Dashboard!"
}


Module 2: Restaurant Application & Management Tests
1. Customer Submits a Restaurant Application
Action: A logged-in CUSTOMER applies to open a restaurant.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/applications/restaurant/apply

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <customer_token>

    "restaurantAddress": "123 API Lane, Hyderabad",
    "restaurantPhone": "9988776655",
    "locationPin": "17.3850,78.4867"
}
Result: 200 OK with the application details and a "status": "PENDING".

2. Admin Approves an Application
Action: An ADMIN approves a pending application, creating a restaurant and upgrading the user's role.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/admin/applications/{applicationId}/approve

Result: 200 OK with the details of the newly created Restaurant entity.

3. Admin Rejects an Application
Action: An ADMIN rejects a pending application.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/admin/applications/{applicationId}/reject

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

Body:

JSON

{
    "reason": "Incomplete documentation provided."
}
Result: 200 OK with a success message.

4. Approved Owner Adds a Menu Item
Action: A newly approved RESTAURANT_OWNER adds an item to their menu.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/restaurant/menu

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <new_owner_token> (This required logging in again as the user to get a token with the updated role).

Body:

JSON

{
    "name": "Chicken Tikka Masala",
    "description": "Grilled chicken chunks in a spiced curry sauce.",
    "price": 400.00
