‚úÖ How to Test Role-Based Access
Here‚Äôs how you can test that the new security rule is working correctly.

Test 1: Access Denied for a Regular User
Register a new user (or use "alice@example.com" if she's still in your database). This user will have the CUSTOMER role.

Log in as the CUSTOMER user (alice@example.com) to get a JWT token.

Try to access the admin endpoint with that token.

Request:

Method: GET

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/admin/dashboard

Headers:

Authorization: Bearer <token_from_customer_login>

Expected Response:

Status: 403 Forbidden

This proves that users without the ADMIN role cannot access the endpoint.

Test 2: Access Granted for the Admin User
Log in as the default admin user.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login

Body:

JSON

{
    "email": "admin@foodnow.com",
    "password": "admin123"
}
You will receive a new JWT token for the admin.

Access the admin endpoint using the admin's token.

Request:

Method: GET

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/admin/dashboard

Headers:

Authorization: Bearer <token_from_admin_login>

Expected Response:

Status: 200 OK

Body:

JSON

{
    "message": "Welcome to the Admin Dashboard!"
}
